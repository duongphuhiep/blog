As a passionate programer, my blog contents usually express my programing experiences, my personal opinions on how things work...

My native-language is vietnamese so you will find many english spelling issues everywhere. Although I will keep writing most of my content in this "bad" english because:

* Most of the reader are developers who usually understand english anyway.
* Hopefully, my writing will improve with time, otherwise it will never improve.

Sometimes (if somebody ask me to) I can re-write a post in vietnamese / or mixed languages contents.
