# My personal website

This is a work in progress

None of the free blogging platforms fit my taste!

I've got no choice, but to create my own blog..

There is so many website generator today.
I don't wanna get trouble for a small personal blog.. so
I picked the (likely) most mature and popular one with a huge community backup..

=> Thanks all the guys behind [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## TODO

* gather my old writing all over places on the internet
* look for a nice theme (or tweak my own theme if nothing fit my taste). This current theme is just my random choice..
* add search capability
* add comment capability (facebook and/or disq)
* publish the blog on github.io
